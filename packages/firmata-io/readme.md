npm install firmata-io --save
```

Install a Transport:


```sh
npm install serialport --save
```

## Transports

- Serialport
- Etherport

# Basic Usage

## With A _Transport Class_

Here's an example using the `Serialport` class:

```js
// Require your Transport!
const Serialport = require("serialport");
// Pass the Transport class to the transport binding
// function exported by firmata-io. The transport binding
// function will return the Firmata class object with
// the Transport class bound in its scope.
const Firmata = require("firmata-io")(Serialport);

Firmata.requestPort((error, port) => {
  if (error) {
    console.log(error);
    return;
  }

  const board = new Firmata(port.path);

  board.on("close", () => {
    // Unplug the board to see this event!
    console.log("Closed!");
  });
});
```

## With A _Transport Instance_

Here's an example using a `Serialport` instance:

```js
// Require your Transport!
const Serialport = require("serialport");
// Get the Firmata class without a bound transport.
const Firmata = require("firmata-io").Firmata;

Serialport.list().then(ports => {
  // Figure which port to use...
  const port = ports.find(port => port.manufacturer.startsWith("Arduino"));

  // Instantiate an instance of your Transport class
  const transport = new Serialport(port.path);

  // Pass the new instance directly to the Firmata class
  const board = new Firmata(transport);

  board.on("close", () => {
    // Unplug the board to see this event!
    console.log("Closed!");
  });
});
```
